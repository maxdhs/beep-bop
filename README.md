Behavior:                           Input:                    Output:
The program does nothing to            3                         3
non-alphabetical characters,
since they do not contain
consonants or vowels.

The program adds "ay" to               i                          iay
single-letter words beginning
with a vowel.

If the first consonants include        queen                      eenquay
"qu", move the "u" along with
the "q". Don't forget about words
like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't
come first!

For words beginning with "y",           yellow                      ellowyay
treat "y" as a consonant.

Take beginning consonants and place     drake                     akedray
at end of word and add ay

For words beginning with a vowel,         orange                    orangeway
add "way" to the end.
